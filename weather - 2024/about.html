    <h1>About Weather Prediction Project</h1>
    <p>
        This research project explores the correlation between weather conditions and the feasibility of playing a tennis game. We employ the Random Forest algorithm for predictive analysis, taking into account various weather variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our goal is to assist tennis players and organizers in making informed decisions regarding game participation, ultimately enhancing the overall tennis experience. We've created a weather prediction tool to help you determine whether it's a good day to play tennis based on the weather conditions in your area.
