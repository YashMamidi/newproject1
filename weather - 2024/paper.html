<section>
  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  <p>We have developed a weather prediction using Adaboost algorithm is a machine learning model for predicting whether to play tennis based on weather conditions, using the AdaBoost Classifier algorithm. The program loads a dataset from a CSV file, preprocesses it by encoding categorical attributes, drops the "day" column, and selects two features: humidity and wind. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, trains the AdaBoost Classifier model on the training data, and evaluates the model's accuracy on the test data. The model's accuracy score is printed, indicating how well it performs in predicting whether to play tennis. Additionally, the program includes a section to demonstrate how to use the trained model to make predictions for new input data. In summary, this program showcases the entire process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using a simple classification algorithm, AdaBoost Classifier, for a tennis-playing decision based on weather attributes.</p>

  <h1> INTRODUCTION </h1>
<p>The provided program is designed to determine whether a person can play a tennis game or not based on certain weather-related features. The program utilizes machine learning techniques and the AdaBoost Classifier to make this prediction. Let's break down the program's functionality into five paragraphs for a concise introduction.
First, in the preprocessing phase, The program begins by importing essential libraries, including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. It reads a dataset from a file named "tennis.csv" using pandas. This dataset presumably contains information related to playing tennis, and the "day" column is dropped as it may not be relevant to the prediction.
Label encoding is applied to convert categorical data into numerical values, making it suitable for machine learning. This initial data processing step prepares the dataset for further analysis. The program provides an insight into the dataset by displaying its shape, the first ten rows, and summary statistics. 
It reveals that the dataset comprises 1599 rows and 12 columns. The columns include features like humidity and wind, which are used to make predictions. Additionally, it demonstrates that the labels ("play") have been transformed into numerical values. Data quality checks are performed to detect and handle missing values, ensuring data integrity.   
The program focuses on specific features required for the prediction task. It selects "humidity" and "wind" as the independent variables (features) to determine whether one can play tennis or not. The labels, denoting whether tennis can be played, are stored in the "play" variable. The data is then split into training and testing sets, a crucial step for model evaluation.
Machine learning is employed to build a predictive model using the AdaBoost Classifier.  AdaBoost is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a robust classifier. In this program, it is used with a specified number of estimators (weak classifiers). The model is trained on the training data, which consists of humidity and wind as input features and the play/no-play labels.
The program concludes by evaluating the model's performance. It uses the accuracy score to assess the model's ability to predict whether tennis can be played. The accuracy score is calculated by comparing the predictions made by the model on the testing data with the actual, ground-truth labels. The result is presented as a percentage, indicating the accuracy of the trained model in making predictions. Furthermore, the program showcases how the model can be used to predict whether one can play tennis under specific weather conditions, providing a glimpse of its practical application.
In summary, this program employs machine learning, specifically the AdaBoost Classifier, to predict whether one can play tennis based on humidity and wind conditions. It begins with data preprocessing, explores the dataset, selects relevant features, and trains a predictive model. Finally, it evaluates the model's accuracy and demonstrates how it can be used to make predictions, which could be valuable for anyone planning a game of tennis in varying weather conditions.

<h1> Algorithms</h1>
<p> <u> AdaBoost Classifier:</u>
    AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a popular ensemble learning method used for classification tasks.
    It combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier.
    Each weak classifier is trained sequentially, with the emphasis on misclassified instances in the subsequent classifiers.
    The final prediction is determined by a weighted majority vote of the weak classifiers.
    <b><u> Algorithm Workflow:</b></u> <br>
   <b> Data Preprocessing:</b>
    Categorical attributes are encoded using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical values.
    The "day" column is dropped from the dataset as it doesn't contribute to the prediction.
    <br><b>Feature Selection:</b>
    Two features, namely humidity and wind, are selected for predicting whether to play tennis.
    <br><b>Model Training:</b>
    The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split function.
    AdaBoostClassifier is trained on the training data.
    <br><b>Model Evaluation:</b>
    The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated on the test data using accuracy_score metric.
   <br> <b>Prediction:</b>
    The trained model is used to predict whether to play tennis based on new input data.
